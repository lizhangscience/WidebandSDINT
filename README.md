# WidebandSDINT
Joint Reconstruction of Wideband Single Dish and Interferometer data for Radio Astronomy

Publication : A Joint Deconvolution Algorithm to Combine Single-dish and Interferometer Data for Wideband Multiterm and Mosaic Imaging , Rau, U. ; Naik, N. ; Braun, T. Astronomical Journal, Volume 158, Number 1, June 2019 

This repository contains a script that works with CASA, two simulated datasets, and a series of output figures to compare and evaluate the results of different algorithmic options.

The Runs directory contains a set of output figures generated by running the scripts on the provided data. It does not contain the output CASA images or logs. 

To run the examples,

(1) Download data from ftp://ftp.aoc.nrao.edu/pub/staff/rurvashi/Data_For_WidebandSDINT_UR_github.tgz  and untar inside the Data directory.

(2) Run scripts from the Runs directory, within CASA.  

execfile('../Scripts/runsdint.py')
runtest(1);runtest(2);runtest(3); etc.... 

Generated outputs are CASA log files, output CASA image files, and PNG figure files that summarize the imaging results for each example. Scripts/sunsdint.py contains documentation on each of the tests triggered by runtest(num).
